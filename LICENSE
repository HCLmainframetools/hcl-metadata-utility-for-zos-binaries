Customer will pay a License fee (“Fee”) for each Program upon receipt of an invoice.  For Programs that are delivered electronically, upon request from HCL, Customer agrees to provide HCL with documentation supporting that the designated Programs were received electronically.  For Programs HCL provides to Licensee in tangible form, HCL fulfills its shipping and delivery obligations upon the delivery of such Programs to the HCL-designated carrier, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and HCL. The Programs are accepted the day HCL delivers the Programs either physically to the carrier or by providing access code(s) for electronic download, whichever occurs first.

To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, HCL may request that Licensee 1) allow HCL to remotely or physically access Licensee’s system or 2) send Licensee information or system data to HCL.  However, HCL is not obligated to provide such assistance unless HCL and Licensee enter a separate written agreement under which HCL agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which are also provided by HCL without any warranty, in this Agreement.  In any event, HCL uses information about errors and problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings.

Licensee will not send or provide HCL access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other amounts that HCL may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to HCL or the loss or disclosure of such information by HCL, including those arising out of any third party claims.

9.0	AUDIT

Customer agrees that HCL may annually audit relevant books and records (including electronic records), devices, computers, servers, and systems of Customer, its Affiliates, consultants, service providers and contractors (collectively, “Customer Entity(ies)”), relating to the Program in order to verify the use of the Program in compliance with this Agreement.  HCL may make copies of any such books and records to the extent necessary to verify Customer’s compliance with the terms hereof.  HCL may conduct the audit itself or at its option engage an independent third party to do such audit.  The audit may be conducted at any sites of Customer Entities, where the Program is installed, used or accessed from, including remotely.  HCL shall bear its own costs in connection with an audit. HCL will provide fifteen (15) calendar days’ notice prior to an audit, except where there is a reasonable cause to suspect that there is an infringement of intellectual property rights, in which case only two (2) business days’ notice will be required.  Any such audit will be performed during Customer Entity’s normal business hours and in a manner that minimizes the disruption to its business.  Customer Entities shall provide all assistance reasonably necessary for HCL to carry out such audit.  If the audit reveals underpayments, Customer shall promptly make such payments.  If the audit reveals under-reporting of usage, Customer shall promptly pay for the differentials at HCL’s then list price for the Program.  HCL’s rights and remedies in this subsections shall be without prejudice to other rights and remedies HCL has under this Agreement, at law or in equity.  HCL’s rights under this provision shall survive any termination or expiry of this Agreement for two years.

10.0	TERMINATION

Upon thirty (30) days’ advance written notice, either Party may terminate this Agreement on a prospective basis.  HCL may (i) terminate the Licenses to the Programs if Customer fails to pay the applicable Fees due within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice from HCL of non-payment; (ii) terminate Licenses to the Programs, and/or this Agreement, without notice or cure period, if Customer violates the intellectual property rights of HCL, its Affiliates or its licensors, or uses the Program outside the scope of the License; or (iii) terminate all Licenses and this Agreement in whole or part if Customer commits any other material breach of this Agreement and fails to cure the breach within thirty (30) days after HCL notifies Customer in writing of the breach.   Upon termination of a License, (a) Customer will immediately uninstall and discontinue use of the relevant Program, (b) upon HCL’s request, Customer will immediately return such Program to HCL, together with all related Documentation and copies or certify its destruction in writing, and (c) all Support obligations of HCL under the Agreement, if any, will come to an end.
